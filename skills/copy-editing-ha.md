- Plain language always — avoid jargon, technical terms, and corporate speak

### Common Competitors & Differentiation

Holo Alert competes with companies like Medical Guardian, Bay Alarm Medical, Life Alert, MedicalAlert.com, and other PERS (Personal Emergency Response System) providers. Key differentiators: Canadian monitoring, no landline required, modern device design, and straightforward pricing.

### Words & Phrases to Prefer

- "Peace of mind" over "safety system"

- "Device included" (for agreement plans)

### Words & Phrases to Avoid

- "Elderly" — use "seniors" or "older adults"
- "Old people" or "aging" used negatively
- "GPS tracking" — use "location services" (tracking sounds invasive)
- "Panic button" — use "help button" or "emergency button"
- Anything that implies the person is frail, helpless, or a burden
- Heavy fear-based messaging — concern and care are fine, but avoid scare tactics
- "SIM card," "firmware," "cellular network" in customer-facing copy

## Core Philosophy

Good copy editing isn't about rewriting — it's about enhancing. Each pass focuses on one dimension, catching issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once.

**Key principles:**

- Don't change the core message; focus on enhancing it
- Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review
- Each edit should have a clear reason
- Preserve the author's voice while improving clarity
- Keep Holo Alert's brand voice consistent throughout

---

## The Seven Sweeps Framework

Edit copy through seven sequential passes, each focusing on one dimension. After each sweep, loop back to check previous sweeps aren't compromised.

### Sweep 1: Clarity

**Focus:** Can the reader understand what you're saying?

**What to check:**
- Confusing sentence structures
- Unclear pronoun references
- Jargon or insider language (especially technical device terms seniors won't know)
- Ambiguous statements
- Missing context

**Common clarity killers:**
- Sentences trying to say too much
- Abstract language instead of concrete
- Assuming reader knowledge they don't have
- Burying the point in qualifications
- Using technical terms like "IP67" or "4G LTE" without explaining what they mean for the reader

**Process:**
1. Read through quickly, highlighting unclear parts
2. Don't correct yet — just note problem areas
3. After marking issues, recommend specific edits
4. Verify edits maintain the original intent

**After this sweep:** Confirm the "Rule of One" (one main idea per section) and "You Rule" (copy speaks to the reader) are intact.

---

### Sweep 2: Voice and Tone

**Focus:** Is the copy consistent in how it sounds — and does it sound like Holo Alert?

**What to check:**
- Shifts between formal and casual
- Inconsistent brand personality
- Mood changes that feel jarring
- Word choices that don't match the brand
- Copy that sounds too clinical, corporate, or fear-based for Holo Alert's warm tone
- Language that might feel condescending to seniors or overly anxious to family buyers

**Common voice issues:**
- Starting warm and reassuring, becoming corporate or salesy
- Mixing "we" and "the company" or "Holo Alert" references inconsistently
- Using fear tactics in some places and empowerment language in others
- Technical language appearing randomly in otherwise plain-language copy

**Process:**
1. Read aloud to hear inconsistencies
2. Mark where tone shifts unexpectedly
3. Recommend edits that smooth transitions
4. Ensure Holo Alert's warm, confident personality remains throughout

**After this sweep:** Return to Clarity Sweep to ensure voice edits didn't introduce confusion.

---

### Sweep 3: So What

**Focus:** Does every claim answer "why should I care?"

**What to check:**
- Features without benefits
- Claims without consequences
- Statements that don't connect to the reader's life
- Missing "which means..." bridges

**The So What test:**
For every statement, ask "Okay, so what?" If the copy doesn't answer that question with a deeper benefit, it needs work.

❌ "Our devices use 4G LTE cellular networks"
*So what?*
✅ "Your device works anywhere in Canada — at home, at the park, or visiting family — no landline or internet needed"

❌ "Our monitoring center is staffed 24/7"
*So what?*
✅ "Day or night, trained Canadian responders are ready to help the moment you press the button"

**Common So What failures:**
- Feature lists (GPS, fall detection, water resistant) without explaining what that means for daily life
- Impressive-sounding claims that don't land emotionally
- Technical capabilities without human outcomes
- Company achievements that don't help the reader

**Process:**
1. Read each claim and literally ask "so what?"
2. Highlight claims missing the answer
3. Add the benefit bridge or deeper meaning
4. Ensure benefits connect to real desires (independence, peace of mind, family reassurance)

**After this sweep:** Return to Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 4: Prove It

**Focus:** Is every claim supported with evidence?

**What to check:**
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Missing social proof
- Assertions without backup
- "Best" or "leading" without evidence

**Types of proof relevant to Holo Alert:**
- Google Reviews and ratings
- Customer testimonials (with names and specifics)
- "Trusted by hundreds of Canadian families"
- Specific response time or coverage claims
- Device certifications (IP67, carrier certifications)
- Years in business or number of customers served

**Common proof gaps:**
- "Trusted by Canadians" (how many? show a review)
- "Best medical alert system" (according to whom?)
- "Fast response times" (how fast specifically?)
- "Customers love us" (show them saying it)

**Process:**
1. Identify every claim that needs proof
2. Check if proof exists nearby
3. Flag unsupported assertions
4. Recommend adding proof or softening claims

**After this sweep:** Return to So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 5: Specificity

**Focus:** Is the copy concrete enough to be compelling?

**What to check:**
- Vague language ("improve," "enhance," "optimize")
- Generic statements that could apply to any medical alert company
- Round numbers that feel made up
- Missing details that would make it real

**Specificity upgrades for Holo Alert:**

| Vague | Specific |
|---|---|
| Fast response | Help arrives quickly after pressing your button |
| Great coverage | Works anywhere in Canada with cellular service |
| Easy to use | One button press connects you to a live person |
| Affordable | Starting at $39.95/month with your device included |
| Trusted company | Rated 4.8 stars by Canadian families on Google |
| Water resistant | Wear it in the shower — it's fully water resistant |

**Process:**
1. Highlight vague words and phrases
2. Ask "Can this be more specific?"
3. Add numbers, timeframes, or examples
4. Remove content that can't be made specific (it's probably filler)

**After this sweep:** Return to Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion

**Focus:** Does the copy make the reader feel something?

**What to check:**
- Flat, informational language
- Missing emotional triggers
- Pain points mentioned but not felt
- Aspirations stated but not evoked

**Emotional dimensions relevant to Holo Alert:**
- **Family worry:** The nagging fear of "what if something happens and nobody's there"
- **Senior independence:** The pride of living on your own terms
- **Relief:** Knowing help is one button press away
- **Trust:** Feeling safe with real Canadian people on the other end
- **Guilt reduction:** For adult children who can't always be there
- **Dignity:** Wearing something discreet that doesn't scream "medical device"

**Techniques for heightening emotion:**
- Paint the "before" state (the worry, the what-ifs) without being manipulative
- Show the "after" state (the confidence, the peace of mind)
- Use micro-stories or scenarios ("Imagine your mom takes her morning walk...")
- Reference shared experiences Canadian families relate to

**Important:** Heighten emotion authentically. Holo Alert's brand avoids scare tactics. The emotional pull should come from empathy and care, not fear and panic.

**Process:**
1. Read for emotional impact — does it move you?
2. Identify flat sections that should resonate
3. Add emotional texture while staying authentic
4. Ensure emotion serves the message (not manipulation)

**After this sweep:** Return to Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 7: Zero Risk

**Focus:** Have we removed every barrier to action?

**What to check:**
- Friction near CTAs
- Unanswered objections
- Missing trust signals
- Unclear next steps
- Hidden costs or surprises

**Common objections for Holo Alert to address:**
- "My parent won't wear it" → highlight discreet, modern design
- "Is there a contract?" → clarify month-to-month options
- "What if it doesn't work in my area?" → nationwide cellular coverage
- "Is it complicated to set up?" → arrives ready to use
- "What happens when they press the button?" → explain the response process
- "Is it really monitored in Canada?" → yes, 24/7, bilingual

**Risk reducers:**
- Month-to-month options (no long-term commitment required)
- Device included on agreement plans
- Simple setup — arrives ready to use
- Canadian monitoring reassurance
- Clear pricing with no hidden fees
- "Call us with any questions" availability

**Process:**
1. Focus on sections near CTAs
2. List every reason someone might hesitate
3. Check if the copy addresses each concern
4. Add risk reversals or trust signals as needed

**After this sweep:** Return through all previous sweeps one final time: Heightened Emotion, Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, Clarity.

## Quick-Pass Editing Checks

Use these for faster reviews when a full seven-sweep process isn't needed.

### Word-Level Checks

**Cut these words:**
- Very, really, extremely, incredibly (weak intensifiers)
- Just, actually, basically (filler)
- In order to (use "to")
- That (often unnecessary)
- Things, stuff (vague)
- "Simply" or "just" when describing device use (implies it should be easy, can feel condescending)

**Replace these:**

| Weak | Strong |
|---|---|
| Utilize | Use |
| Implement | Set up |
| Leverage | Use |
| Facilitate | Help |
| Innovative | New / Modern |
| Robust | Strong / Reliable |
| Seamless | Smooth / Easy |
| Cutting-edge | Modern |
| Elderly | Seniors / Older adults |
| Panic button | Help button / Emergency button |
| GPS tracking | Location services |

**Watch for:**
- Adverbs (usually unnecessary)
- Passive voice (switch to active)
- Nominalizations (verb → noun: "make a decision" → "decide")
- Technical jargon that slipped through

### Sentence-Level Checks

- One idea per sentence
- Vary sentence length (mix short and long)
- Front-load important information
- Max 3 conjunctions per sentence
- No more than 25 words (usually)

### Paragraph-Level Checks

- One topic per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (2–4 sentences for web, even shorter for email and ads)
- Strong opening sentences
- Logical flow between paragraphs
- White space for scannability

## Common Copy Problems & Fixes (Holo Alert Edition)

### Problem: Wall of Features
**Symptom:** List of device specs (GPS, IP67, 4G LTE, fall detection) without why it matters
**Fix:** Add "which means..." after each feature to bridge to benefits

### Problem: Corporate Speak
**Symptom:** "Leverage our PERS solution to optimize senior safety outcomes"
**Fix:** Ask "How would a caring neighbour say this?" and use those words

### Problem: Fear-Based Opening
**Symptom:** Starting with scary fall statistics or worst-case scenarios
**Fix:** Lead with empowerment, independence, or peace of mind — then address the concern

### Problem: Talking to the Wrong Audience
**Symptom:** Copy addresses seniors but the buyer is their adult child (or vice versa)
**Fix:** Pick one audience and write directly to them

### Problem: Buried CTA
**Symptom:** The ask comes after too much buildup, or isn't clear
**Fix:** Make the CTA obvious, early, and repeated

### Problem: No Proof
**Symptom:** "Canadians trust Holo Alert" with no evidence

### Problem: Generic Claims

### Problem: Condescending Tone
**Symptom:** Copy that makes seniors sound helpless or fragile
**Fix:** Reframe around independence, confidence, and living life on their terms
